**Date**: [2025-08-18]  
**Author**: [@amanusk]

**_Cool past updates_**

1. **_Snforge traces \-_** Running tests with snforge can now print a detailed trace of function calls. Verbosity of traces can be set via a flag, and they include things like, function names, parameters, return values and more. Read more on the debugging features of Starknet-Foundry [docs](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/snforge-advanced-features/debugging.html?highlight=traces#debugging)

**_What’s new:_**

1. **_Full Cairo 2.12 support \-_** The latest version of Starknet-Foundry (0.48) now fully support the latest Cairo 2.12. This comes with improved compilation times and support for the new proc-macros API in the language server. No more red squigly line under the `#[test]` attribute on your tests. Read the 0.48 [migration guide](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/0-48-0-migration-guide.html)
2. **_Verification in sncast_** \- sncast now supports verifying contracts on Voyager. There are now two ways to verify your contract. Either by directly using the [Voyager verification tool](https://github.com/NethermindEth/voyager-verifier), or by using sncast and selecting voyage. Read more in the [docs](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/starknet/verify.html?highlight=verify#verifying-contracts)**_._**
3. **_Scarb profiles in Foundry \-_** You can now use the profiles defined in Scarb.toml, and pass their names to snforge. Use `snforge test –profile <profile_name>` to run in either `dev`, `release` or a custom profile. Now you can customize profiles for either development and debugging or on-chain cost evaluation. Read more about scarb profiles [here](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/profiles.html), and in the post [here](https://starkware.notion.site/Scarb-profiles-and-compilation-optimizations-1d5112692ab280fe9b82f71aecf3246d)

**_What’s next_**

1. **_Better gas reports \-_** We are working to improve gas reports in snforge. Future reports will include contract declaration costs, function cost breakdown, traces with gas costs for inner calls and more.
2. **Audited packages in [scarbs.xyz](http://scarbs.xyz) \-** We are working on marking audited package versions directly visible in [scarbs.xyz](http://scarbs.xyz). You’ll be able to see which version was audited and read the report. Integration with scarb to follow.
