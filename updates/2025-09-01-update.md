# Update #2 - [AI tools and updates]

**Date**: [2025-09-01]  
**Author**: [@amanusk]

**_Cool past updates_**

1. **Starknet agent**: The Starknet agent at [https://agent.starknet.io/](https://agent.starknet.io/) is your go-to tool for any Starknet-related questions. It is connected to all the docs and sources of information. Ask anything about Cairo or Starknet, and it will have the answer for you. Don’t forget to bookmark\!
2. **Starknet Agent Kit (Snak):** The [starknet agent kit](https://github.com/kasarlabs/snak) is a toolkit to abstract and automate contract interactions with an agent. Similarly to other frameworks such as ElizaOS, Snak integrates with the Starknet development stack, and allows to perform on-chain interactions with natural language. Snak is under development as an augmented MCP that covers all of Starknet.

**_What’s new_**

1. **Cairo-Coder:** Cairo-Coder is a new tool, fully [open-source](https://github.com/KasarLabs/cairo-coder) and developed by Kasar Labs. Plug it into Cursor or as an MCP to instantly boost your Cairo (vibe) coding experience. Get an API key and follow the instructions for plugging it into your favorite development environment. More info is in the [docs](https://www.cairo-coder.com/).

2. **Open Zeppelin MCP for contracts.** Open Zeppelin have also released a new MCP, aimed at contract development, and supports both their Solidity and Cairo offerings. Read more on the blog [_post_](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/introducing-contracts-mcp)_._

**_What’s next_**

1. Plugging the Starknet Agent into additional and more “live” data sources, to also be able to answer questions about what is currently happening on the network
2. We are looking for feedback on how we can improve Cairo-Coder and Snak. Please open issues and requests on each project's repository.
